# Dataset Generation Algorithms â€“ Ellipses and Handwritten Characters

This folder contains the core algorithms used to generate custom datasets for simulation and machine learning tasks. The datasets include:

- **Synthetic ellipses** with controlled geometric and acoustic properties
- **Original handwritten characters** captured via a custom canvas-based interface

## Objectives
- Create structured datasets for training and testing classification models
- Simulate variations in shape, orientation, and internal anomalies
- Provide labeled data compatible with image reconstruction and anomaly detection workflows

## Highlights
- Modular Matlab/Python scripts for batch generation and labeling
- Integration-ready outputs for ML pipelines
- Designed to support ultrasonic tomography simulations and pattern recognition tasks

These datasets form the foundation for subsequent reconstruction, classification, and segmentation experiments developed during my master's thesis.

Feel free to explore the code and reach out for feedback or collaboration.
