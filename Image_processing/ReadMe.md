# Image Processing for Machine Learning Integration

This folder contains scripts and workflows focused on signal and image preprocessing, designed to prepare data for machine learning tasks such as classification and anomaly detection.

## Objectives
- Process raw signals and images to extract meaningful features
- Apply normalization, filtering, and transformation techniques
- Automate repetitive preprocessing steps to streamline experimentation
- Structure data for compatibility with supervised and unsupervised learning models

## Highlights
- Batch processing routines to avoid manual repetition
- Preprocessing pipelines for acoustic and tomographic data
- Integration-ready outputs for ML algorithms

These tools are part of a broader framework developed during my master's thesis, aimed at improving reconstruction accuracy and pattern recognition in ultrasound tomography systems.

Feel free to explore the scripts and reach out for feedback or collaboration.
