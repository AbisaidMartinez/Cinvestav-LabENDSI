# Cinvestav-LabENDSI
This repository contains simulation scripts, data processing tools, and GUI components developed as part of my project developed at CINVESTAV Campus Saltillo. The project focuses on ultrasonic tomography using finite-difference methods and machine learning for image reconstruction, anomaly detection, and pattern classification.
