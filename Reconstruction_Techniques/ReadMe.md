# Reconstruction Techniques â€“ Computed Tomography

This folder contains several image reconstruction methods based on **Computed Tomography (CT)** principles. The focus is on understanding and implementing techniques that relate the object to the source-ray geometry using the **Radon Transform**.

## Techniques Included
- **Backprojection**  
- **Filtered Backprojection**  
- **Fan-Beam Projection**  
- **Algebraic Reconstruction Technique (ART)**

Each method explores different approaches to reconstructing internal structures from projection data, highlighting both theoretical foundations and practical implementation.

These techniques are essential for applications in medical imaging, non-destructive testing, and wave-based reconstruction systems.

Feel free to explore the scripts and reach out for feedback or collaboration.
