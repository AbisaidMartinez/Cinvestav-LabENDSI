# Signal Acquisition Simulations using K-Wave

This folder contains simulations related to signal acquisition using **K-Wave**, an open-source MATLAB toolbox for modeling acoustic wave fields.

ðŸ”— You can download the toolbox here: (http://www.k-wave.org)

These simulations were implemented using **MATLAB R2024a**, and include various finite-difference methods to illustrate the underlying concepts of wave propagation and signal reconstruction in heterogeneous media.

The goal is to explore the behavior of acoustic signals under different conditions and provide a foundation for further development in ultrasonic tomography and machine learning-based reconstruction.

Feel free to explore the scripts and reach out for feedback or collaboration.
